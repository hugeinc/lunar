## Git branching model
This repo branching model is **inspired by Git Flow**. Currently we have these types of branches:
- master - Latest release, stable
- develop - Main development, unstable
- release/ - Release archive
- feature/ - Specific features development
- hotfix/ - Emergency fixes for latest release

[Read the Git Flow reference](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).  
This repo uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

### Pull Request
Develop using feature/* branches, make Pull Requests to develop, and finally to master when ready to release.
